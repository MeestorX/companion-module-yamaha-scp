**Instructions**

"MY CHANNEL"

        This setting (in the settings tab - click Edit on the instance tab) allows you to select a channel that will
        be updated in any actions that choose "My Channel" as the channel number instead of CH 1 CH 2 etc. Using
        this means that you can create a layout that can have a specific channel on many buttons that can be changed
        at any time. Useful when things move around from show to show, and then you don't have to change settings
        on a bunch of buttons.

MACROS ("Learn" Function)
        
        This will only work while connected to a console.

        Drag the "Record SCP Macro" Preset to your page, press it to start recording, do stuff, then press it again to
        stop recording. Go back to your presets and there'll be a new "Macro x" preset that you can now drag to
        your page.

        New Macros will disappear when you restart companion, so make sure you drag the ones you want to keep onto
        a button!

        Don't forget that you can create a macro by pressing a SD button (while recording) that already has actions
        on it while a console is connected.
        The new Macro will have those commands in it as well as any you added before you pressed the button or
        after!

DYNAMIC CHANNEL PARAMETERS

        If you add name or color feedback for a button, (e.g. InCh/Label/Name or DCA/Label/Color), the module
        will pull the name or color from the matching channel and change the button text or color accordingly.
